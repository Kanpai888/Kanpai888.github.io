		      	<b>02 Jul 2013</b> This is the first post of many? Migrating from a frankly terrible stock WordPress install to a Jekyll generated static site. The few posts that have every graced the light of day are slowly being migrated into this site. In addition (if I ever get round to it) I will be completely overhalling how everything looks. The current iteration is simply for me to get to grips with how Jekyll works. For those who may not have seen the old one, here's a screenshot for comparison.

		      	<b>16 Jun 2012</b> This is a simple implementation of the Game of Life in Java. I coded this because I wanted something quick and simple to implement as I have been working recently and didn’t have time to work on anything large. You can download a executable jar here to try it out. Or you can find a video of the program running.

		      	<b>16 Jun 2012</b> Hello again! Since I realise that it has been a significant since my first semester exams and first post. Its about time I finally post some updates! This is what I would consider to be my first piece of proper Android code though I had a crash course at DevXS hack weekend and contributed to the creation of Intr; the code I produced whilst fuelled with muffins, tea and a general lack of sleep would not have won any awards (well maybe the “What was I doing here?” award).

		      	<b>12 Jan 2012</b> Hi. This is going to be a development blog of sorts for my future programming endeavours plus anything that happens to grab my attention. I guess a quick introduction is in order. My name is Gen-Nam and I’m currently a student at Southampton University studying Computer Science. I am looking at doing some Android development once the exams are over so that’ll probably come up quite often in the near future.
