title: Hello Jekyll, goodbye Wordpress!
published: true
catergories: [misc]
excerpt: This is the first post of many? Migrating from a frankly terrible stock WordPress install to a Jekyll generated static site. The few posts that have every graced the light of day are slowly being migrated into this site. In addition (if I ever get round to it) I will be completely overhalling how everything looks. The current iteration is simply for me to get to grips with how Jekyll works. For those who may not have seen the old one, here's a screenshot for comparison.
