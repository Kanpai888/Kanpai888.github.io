excerpt: Hi. This is going to be a development blog of sorts for my future programming endeavours plus anything that happens to grab my attention. I guess a quick introduction is in order. My name is Gen-Nam and I’m currently a student at Southampton University studying Computer Science. I am looking at doing some Android development once the exams are over so that’ll probably come up quite often in the near future.

Hi,

This is going to be a development blog of sorts for my future programming endeavours plus anything that happens to grab my attention. I guess a quick introduction is in order. My name is Gen-Nam and I’m currently a student at Southampton University studying Computer Science. I am looking at doing some Android development once the exams are over so that’ll probably come up quite often in the near future.

On a side note if anyone has a summer internship available let me know :)
